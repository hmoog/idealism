# Idealism

A generic Rust crate for building identity-based DLT's that aims to achieve the theoretical optimum in all existing metrics.

## Vision

Distributed Ledger Technology has evolved through various designs, each optimizing for different metrics like messaging complexity, implementation complexity, finality time, or security assumptions. While existing projects excel in specific areas, we believe there exists a unified design that can achieve theoretical optimums across all metrics simultaneously.

Idealism is a research project to demonstrate this optimal design space exists and is practically implementable. Built without token economics or commercial pressures, it aims to serve as a foundation for future distributed systems.

## Goals

- Prove that optimal distributed consensus is achievable in practice
- Provide a minimal yet complete implementation of core consensus mechanisms
- Create a modular framework others can build upon
- Demonstrate that security and performance aren't inherent tradeoffs
- Enable future improvements like Data Availability Sampling and stateless validation

## Project Status

Currently implementing core consensus mechanisms. We welcome discussions and contributions around theoretical models, implementation approaches, and potential applications.

## Contributing

We're open to contributions and discussions. Feel free to:
- Open issues for questions or suggestions
- Submit PRs for improvements
- Share ideas about potential applications
- Help improve documentation

Join us in exploring what's possible at the theoretical limits of distributed systems.

Note: The project is currently in its foundational phase. First code will be released soon as we complete the core consensus implementation.
